# Luigi Notes

* Two fundamental building blocks
  * `Task`
    * `Parameter` determines how a `Task` is run.
    * Consume `Targets` generated by another `Task`.
    * Generally also output `Targets`.
    * Define dependencies between **`Tasks`**.
    * Required functions: `run()`, `output()`, `requires()`
    * `run()`
      * 
  * `Target`
    * Corresponds to some kind of checkpoint, e.g. a file on disk that needs to be generated.
